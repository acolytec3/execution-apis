# Introduction

Welcome to the Ethereum Execution APIs documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the JSON-RPC APIs provided by Ethereum 1.0 clients.

## What are Execution APIs?

Execution APIs are the set of JSON-RPC endpoints that allow applications to interact with Ethereum nodes. These APIs enable developers to:

- Query blockchain data
- Send transactions
- Interact with smart contracts
- Monitor network status
- And much more

## Getting Started

To get started with the Execution APIs:

1. Choose an Ethereum client implementation
2. Set up your development environment
3. Connect to an Ethereum node
4. Start making JSON-RPC calls

## API Categories

The Execution APIs are organized into several categories:

- Core APIs
- Account APIs
- Network APIs
- Debug APIs
- Trace APIs

Each category serves specific purposes and provides different functionalities for interacting with the Ethereum network.
